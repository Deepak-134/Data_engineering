## Declare Variables And Types

* Immutable variables :- Variables whose value cannot be changed.
    val <Name of our variable>: <Scala type> = <Some literal>
    Ex. val empid: int = 100
    
* Mutable variables :- Variables whose value can be changed, which are used in loops for increament purpose.
    var <Name of our variable>: <Scala type> = <Some literal>
    Ex. var count: int = 0
