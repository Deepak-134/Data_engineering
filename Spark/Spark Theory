1) Global Temporary View.
---> Temporary views in Spark SQL are session-scoped and will disappear if the session that creates it terminates. If you want to have a temporary view that is shared among 
     all sessions and keep alive until the Spark application terminates, you can create a global temporary view. Global temporary view is tied to a system preserved database 
     global_temp, and we must use the qualified name to refer it, e.g. SELECT * FROM global_temp.view1
     
     df.createGlobalTempView('emp')
     df2 = spark.sql('select * from global_temp.emp')
