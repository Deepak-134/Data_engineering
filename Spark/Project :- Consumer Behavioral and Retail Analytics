Usecase/Goal :-
    The goal of this project is to identify patterns and trends in the data that can inform business strategies and provide actionable recommendations for the company. 
    Help the business make data driven decisions by analyzing their data and providing insights that can improve sales, customer satisfaction and overall productivity. 
    Also help the company optimize their inventory management, pricing, seasonal hiring, marketing compaigns, and other key areas of the business.

Flow / Architecture of Project :-
    The client data was stored in a On-premise Oracle database from where we needed to migrate the data to cloud into AWS S3 storage
    in parquet file format which was done by AWS DMS (Database Migration Service). Once the data is migrated its schema is mapped into the Data Catalogue
    into AWS Glue. After that we would perform data validation over the migrated data. Once the validation is complete we would
    apply various preprocessing steps over the data as per business logic and write the cleaned and transformaed data to Snowflake 
    warehouse with the help of AWS Glue which is a fully managed ETL service. Afterwords the snowflake data is used by a team of
    BI developers to create dashboards and reports to be used for decision making by management personal.
