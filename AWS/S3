 ---- Storage classes                                     
    1) S3 Standard :- General purpose storage for active, with frequently accessed data with miliseconds access.                                           
    2) S3 Standard - IA (Infrequent Access) :- Lower cost storage for data accessed monthly, with milisecond retrival.                    
    3) S3 One Zone- IA (Infrequent Access) :- Performance of s3 standard-IA stored in a single AZ at 20% of the cost.                     
    4) S3 Intelligent Tiering :- It moves objects between various storage classes by analysing their access patterns which leads to cost effectivness.           
    5) S3 Glacier Instant Retrival :- Lowest cost storage for long-term archive data, with milisecond retrival. Ex., like digital data accessed per Quarter.
    6) S3 Glacier Flexible Retrival :- Archive or backup data with secure, durable and low-cost storage, retrival speed in between minutes-hours.
    7) S3 Glaricer Deep Archive :-  Lowest cost cloud storage for long-term archives at about $1 per TB/month. Retrival speed in hours.

            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::snowflakebigdata",
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": "13.127.137.221/24"           # It is Public IP
