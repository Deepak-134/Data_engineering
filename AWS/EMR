EMR (Elastic MapReduce)

Features of EMR:-
    1) EMR Step :- We can submit jobs and interact directly with the data frameworks that is installed in the Amazon EMR cluster. 
    Alternatively, we can submit one or more ordered steps to an Amazon EMR cluster. Each step is a unit of work that contains instructions to 
    manipulate data for processing by the data framework installed on the cluster.
