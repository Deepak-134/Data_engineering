Q.) Scope and namespaces in python ?
	Namespaces are containers that hold names and objects, while scope defines the visibility and accessibility of names within a program. 
	Namespaces help organize names and avoid naming conflicts, while scope determines where a name can be referenced and accessed. 
	Namespaces and scope work together to provide a structured way to manage names and objects in Python programs.

Q.) Scope in python ?
	Scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of names (variables, functions, objects) within a program.
	It defines the region of the code where a particular name can be referenced.
	Scopes determine the lifetime and accessibility of names and manage the binding of names to objects.
	Python has local scope, global scope, and built-in scope.
	Scopes define the rules for resolving names during runtime, determining which namespace to search for a name.
	Python follows the LEGB rule for name resolution: Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in.

Q.) Namespaces in Python ?
	In Python, a namespace is a system that maps names (identifiers) to objects. It serves as a container for holding variables, functions, classes, and 
	other objects. Namespaces help organize and avoid naming conflicts within a program.
	Three types :- local namespace (It includes name defined at function level like variable, etc), 
				         global namespace (It includes names defined at the module level, such as global variables, functions, and classes.)
				         Built-in Namespace (The built-in namespace contains the names of all the built-in functions, classes, and exceptions provided by Python itself. 
									   These names, such as print(), len(), int(), etc., are available in any Python program without the need for explicit imports.)
	When a name is referenced in Python, the interpreter first searches for it in the local namespace. If the name is not found, it then looks in the global 
	namespace. Finally, if the name is still not found, it searches in the built-in namespace. This process is known as the "namespace resolution" or "name lookup" process.
