SQL theroy questions:-
	1) Types of constraints in SQL
		- NOT NULL :- create table school (class varchar2(20) NOT NULL)
		- UNIQUE :- create table school (class varchar2(20) UNIQUE)  -- UNIQUE constraint allows null values
		- PRIMARY KEY :- create table school (class varchar2(30) PRIMARY KEY);
		- FOREIGN KEY :- create table school (class varchar2(30) , teachers varchar2(40), CONSTRAINT tech_fk FOREIGN KEY (teach_id) REFERENCES teacher(teach_id));
		  It is used to validate data in one table with data in another table. NULL values are allowed in Foreign Key columns.
		- CHECK :- It is used to enforce conditions over the table.
		  create table school (class varchar2(30) , teachers varchar2(40), CONSTRAINT CHECK (class LIKE '%_upper'));

	2) DDL (auto commit):- create , drop , alter , truncate 
	   DML (manual commit):- insert , update , delete, 
	
	3) Delete vs truncate
		DELETE can remove one or more selected rows from a table, while TRUNCATE removes all rows from the table.
		DELETE can be rolled back if used within a transaction, while TRUNCATE cannot be rolled back.
		DELETE removes rows one by one, which can be slower for large tables, while TRUNCATE removes all rows at once, which is faster and more efficient.
		Delete data can be recovered if not commited because , but Truncate data cannot be recovered because it auto-commits the changes.		
		
	4) union and union all
		UNION and UNION ALL are two commands which are used to combine the result set of two or more queries.
		UNION removes duplicate records from the final result set, while UNION ALL includes all records, including duplicates.
		UNION is slower than UNION ALL because it has to check for and remove duplicate records, while UNION ALL does not have to do this.
		UNION requires that the number of columns and their data types be the same in all SELECT statements being combined, 
		while UNION ALL does not have this requirement.
				
	5) rank and dense rank
		Both RANK() and DENSE_RANK() functions are used to assign a ranking to rows within a query result set based on the value of one or more columns. 
		However, the main difference between these two functions is how they handle ties.
		The RANK() function assigns a unique rank to each distinct value in the result set. If two or more rows have the same value, they are assigned the same rank,
		and the next rank is skipped. For example, if two rows have the same value and are assigned rank 3, the next row will be assigned rank 5 (skipping rank 4).
		
		On the other hand, the DENSE_RANK() function assigns a unique rank to each distinct value in the result set, but when there are ties, the same rank is 
		assigned to each tied row, and the next rank is not skipped. This means that if two rows have the same value and are assigned rank 3, the next row will 
		be assigned rank 4 (not skipping rank 4).
	
	6) Views in SQL ? Types and defination
		Simple View:
		A simple view is a virtual table that is created by defining a SELECT statement with a unique name. The view does not store any data, but rather acts 
		as a window through which the data can be viewed. When a user queries a simple view, the query is executed against the underlying base tables.
		Simple views are useful when you want to limit the amount of data that a user can access, or when you want to provide a simplified or 
		customized view of the data.
		
		Materialized view :-
		A materialized view in SQL is a database object that contains the results of a query that has been precomputed and stored in a table-like structure. 
		Materialized views are used to improve the performance of database queries by reducing the amount of time required to compute the results.
		Materialized views are especially useful for queries that require complex joins, aggregations, or calculations, as the results can be precomputed and 
		stored for quick retrieval. They can also be used to cache the results of frequently executed queries, reducing the need for repeated expensive computations.
	
	7) SQL execution order
			from
			join
			where
			group by
			having
			select
			distinct
			orderby
			limit

	8) SQL optimization techniques :- 

		select only the columns we need. (projection pushdown)
		use limit clause to limit query result. 
		avoid select distinct if possible (instead of distinct we can use groupby because distinct requires more processing power)
		run queries in non busy hours
		use CTE
		use indexes
		use inner join instead of other join if possible (inner join is faster than left join)
		always order your join large table to small table (large table should be on left side)
		avoid using corelated subquery (it checks each outer query record with each inner query record)
			
	9) Fact table and dimension table :-
		Fact table :- Fact tables store primary keys of dimension tables as foreign keys within the fact table. 
		In a data warehouse, a fact table is a table that stores the measurements, metrics, or facts related to a business operation.
		It is located at the center of a star or snowflake schema and is surrounded by dimension tables.
		Dimension table :-
		Dimension tables contain descriptions of the objects in a fact table and provide information about dimensions such as values, characteristics, and keys.
		
		We can perform arithmatic operations on fact table but we cannot do that in dimension table columns
		fact table :- salary, year, profit    dimension table :- name, product name, customer name, product category
		e.g., suppose we have a column prod_id in fact table , for it we can have a dimension table containing prod_name , stock, price, weight , etc, description
		
	10) Types of schema (star, snowflake, galaxy) :-
		Schema :- In warehouse schema is nothing but the organization of how data is stored and how it relates to other data within the data warehouse.
		Star schema :- all dimension table are connected to a central fact table
		snowflake schema :- This data warehouse schema builds on the star schema by adding additional sub-dimension tables that relate to first-order dimension tables joined to the fact table. 
		galaxy schema :- collection of star schema , Galaxy Schema uses multiple fact tables connected with shared normalized dimension tables. 
			
	11) What is normalisation ? Which schema is more normalized ?  What are the steps in data normalisation ?
		Normalisation :- 
		Normalisation divides a denormalised table in simpler fact and dimension tables.
		Normalization is used to remove redundant data from the database and to store non-redundant and consistent data into it.
		Normalization is generally used where a number of insert/update/delete operations are performed and joins of those tables are not expensive.
		
		Denormalization :-
		Denormalization is used to combine multiple table data into one so that it can be queried quickly.
		Denormalization is used where joins are expensive and frequent queries are executed on the tables.
		
		The snowflake schema is a fully normalized data structure. Because they have sub dimension tables.

	12) clustered and non-clustered index ?
		Indexing is a optimisation technique in SQL, it reduces the data to be read from the table based on indexed column.
		Index gets automatically generated if the primary key and unique constraint are defined on the table.
		There are 2 types of index :-
		Clustered index :- clustered index has to maintain the physical order of the stored records according to the indexed column i.e. id. 
						   Their can only be 1 clustered index per table.
						   They do not consume extra storage as data is stored in ordered fashion. 
		Non-clustered index :- Their can be more than 1 non-clustered index per table. Non-clustered indexes are stored in a separate place from the actual table  
				       claiming more storage space. Clustered indexes are faster than non-clustered indexes since they don’t involve any extra lookup step.
				       Non-clustered index shows the position of data in table to access it.
							   
	13) How handle null values in SQL ?
		- IS NULL :- select * from table where name IS NULL;
		- IS NOT NULL
		- COALESCE(): The COALESCE() function takes unlimited parameters and returns the first non-null expression in a list. # COALESCE(email, phone, name)
		- NVL :- select name , NVL(salary, 0) from table;     # NVL(col, if_null)
		- NVL2 :- select name , NVL2(salary, 10, 100) from table      # NVL2(col, if_not_null, if_null)
		- CASE WHEN :- CASE WHEN country IS NOT NULL THEN country
				    WHEN state IN ('maharashtra','gujarat') THEN 'INDIA'
			       ELSE 'NO COUNTRY'
			       END as 'country_all'
				
	14) Slowly Changing Dimension (SDCs) in Data warehouse ?
		Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) are a concept in data warehousing that deal with how to handle changes to dimension data over time. 
		In a data warehouse, dimensions represent the characteristics or attributes of the data being analyzed. These dimensions can change over time due 
		to various reasons, such as updates, inserts, or deletions of dimension records.
		Type 1 SCD: In this approach, no historical data is preserved, and any changes overwrite the existing dimension record.
		Type 2 SCD: Type 2 SCDs preserve historical data by creating a new dimension record for each change. This typically involves adding a new row with 
		a unique identifier (such as a surrogate key) and the updated attributes. 
		Type 3 SCD: Type 3 SCDs maintain a limited amount of historical data by adding new columns to the dimension table to store specific changes. 
		Typically, these columns capture the previous and current values of specific attributes.
		
	15) Temporary tables ?
		Temporary tables in SQL are a type of database object that allow you to store intermediate or temporary data like query results within a session.
		Temporary tables are specific to a particular session or connection. They are created and used within a session and are automatically dropped at the end of the session or when explicitly dropped by the user.
		Temporary tables are useful when you need to store intermediate results or perform complex multi-step calculations.
		
		CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temporary_table_name 
		SELECT * FROM original_table_name;
				
	16) Stored procedures ? Types of stored procedures ?
		Stored procedures in SQL are sets of precompiled SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed on demand. 
		Types :-
		a) Simple Stored Procedures: These are basic stored procedures that contain a single SQL statement or a small set of SQL statements. They are commonly used 
		for tasks such as inserting, updating, or deleting records in a database table.
		b) Parameterized Stored Procedures: Parameterized stored procedures allow for passing parameters to the procedure, which can be used in the SQL statements 
		within the procedure. This enables dynamic and flexible execution of the procedure based on the provided parameter values.
		c) System Stored Procedures: System stored procedures are built-in procedures provided by the database management system (DBMS). They are used for 
		administrative tasks, managing security, optimizing performance, and other system-related operations. Examples of system stored procedures include 
		sp_adduser and sp_helpdb in Microsoft SQL Server.
		d) Nested Stored Procedures: Nested stored procedures are procedures that call other stored procedures within them. This allows for modular and hierarchical 
		organization of code logic, where a higher-level procedure can invoke and utilize the functionality of lower-level procedures.
		e) Recursive Stored Procedures: Recursive stored procedures are procedures that call themselves, allowing for iterative processing or traversing 
		hierarchical data structures. Recursive procedures are particularly useful for tasks such as processing tree structures or recursive queries.
		f) CLR Stored Procedures: CLR (Common Language Runtime) stored procedures are stored procedures written in a programming language that is compatible with 
		the .NET Framework, such as C# or VB.NET. CLR stored procedures provide additional flexibility and functionality by allowing you to use the features and libraries provided by the .NET Framework.

	17) Triggers ? Types of triggers ?
		Trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically executes in response to specific events or actions occurring in the database. 
		These events can include data modifications (such as inserting, updating, or deleting records) or database operations (such as creating or altering tables).
		Triggers are commonly used to enforce data integrity, maintain consistency, and automate certain tasks within database.
		Types :- DDL triggers :- Triggers  in response to a DDL change.
			 DML triggers :- Triggers  in response to a DML change.
			 LOGON trigger :- Logon triggers are fires in response to a LOGON event. The LOGON event occurs when a user session is generated with an SQL Server
			 		  instance, which is made after the authentication process of logging is completed but before establishing a user session.
	18) Local variable and global variable in sql ?
		In sql variables are used to store values temporarly during execution of a script or a batch of statement. They are divided into 2 types :
		Local variable :- Local variables are declared and used within a specific block of code, such as a stored procedure, function, or batch of statements. 
						  They are only accessible within the block in which they are defined.
						  DECLARE @myVariable INT;
						  SET @myVariable = 10;
   						  SELECT @myVariable;
		Global variable :- Global variables are declared at the database level and can be accessed across multiple blocks of code, including stored procedures, 
						   functions, or different batches of statements within the same database.
			
	19) Set operators :- (UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, MINUS)
	
	20) Rownum Vs Rowid :- ROWID have distinct purposes. ROWNUM is used for row numbering within a result set, 
							while ROWID is used for identifying a specific row within a table based on its physical location or identifier.
		
	21) VARCHAR & VARCHAR2 :- VARCHAR and VARCHAR2 are data types used to store variable-length character strings. 
				  VARCHAR stores 2000 bytes of character data , VARCHAR2 stores 4000 bytes of character data, also VARCHAR2 is only specific to Oracle.
	
	22)  How will you copy schema of one table to another?
	------> CREATE TABLE emp AS SELECT * FROM emp2 WHERE 1=2;
		
Queries :-

1) Write sql query to find 3rd highest salary from the table (use windows function)
	select * from
	(select t.*, dense_rank() over(order by salary desc) as dense_rank
	from table t)
	where dense_rank = 3;
	
2) Write sql query to find 3rd highest salary from the table (without using windows function)
	select * from 
	(select distinct salary from table
	order by salary desc
	limit 3)
	order by salary asc
	limit 1;

3) write sql query to find highest salary in each department 
		emp                              dept 
		id name salary dept_id         id  dept_name
		1  joe  70000   1               1   IT
		2  jeem 90000   1               2   SALES
		3  henry 80000  2
		4  sam  60000   2
		5  max  90000   1

		---->  Output
		Department Employ salary
		IT         max    90000
		IT         jeem   90000
		SALES      Henry  80000

Sol :- 

   select department, emp1.name, emp1.salary from
   (select  emp1.* , dept.dept_name as department, dense_rank() over(partition by dept.dept_name order by emp1.salary desc) as dn
   from emp1 left outer join dept 
   on emp1.dept_id = dept.id)
   where dn = &N;
   
4) Write sql query to find duplicate records from table.
			country
		
			india
			england
			india
			pakistan
	        england

Sol :-  select country from table
	group by country having count(*) > 1
		
	Can we use where clause here :- No, in where clause we cannot use aggrigate function but after having clause we can use aggrigate function
		
5) Delete duplicate records from table.

id     name
1		aa
2		bb
3		aa

Sol :- 	delete from table
	where rowid not in
	(select max(rowid) from table group by id, name) 

If there is no concept of rowid like in MySQL then,
	alter table emp add constraint unique(id, name)
	OR	
	create table emp2 as select distinct id, name from emp;

6) Find employ and its manager name
		Input                               Output
		empid name   manager_id        empname   managername
		1     vikas  3                 vikas     yash
		2     pooja  1          ---->  pooja     vikas
		3     yash   2                 yash      pooja

Sol :-  select t1.name as empname, t2.name as managername
	from tab t1 inner join tab t2
	on t1.manager_id = t2.empid;
		
7) Input                  Output
   id teams              
   1  India              India Vs Pakistan
   2  Pakistan    -----> India Vs srilanka
   3  srilanka           Pakistan Vs srilanka
   
Sol :-  select t1.id||" Vs "||t2.id as matches
		from table t1 join table t2
		on t1.id < t2.id
		
Note :- If in some problems id column not given , then generate row_number column , like

colour
Red
Green
Yellow

with a as		
(select color, row_number() over(order by rownum) as rn from table)
select a1.colour || "--" ||a2.colour
from a a1 join a a2
on a1.rn < a2.rn


8) 	Input                        Output

	gender  marks                     
							   gender marks
	male    100                M       370
	men     80                 F       200
	boy     90  ------->
	man     100
	women   20
	female  100
	girl     80

Sol :-  select G, sum(marks)
	from   (select gender, marks, case when gender in ('male','men','boy','man') then 'M'
				       else 'F'
				       End as G
		from table)
	group by G;
		
9) What is the Number of records in output when use inner join and left join and right join to join
   this 2 tables

		TableA    TableB
		1         1 
		1         1

	   null	null
	   null	null
	   
Note :- 
According to rule number 3rd of rdbms , null is not a value to compare but missing information

Natural join :- In natural join we don't need to mention joining column it automatically finds the join column and perform join , if joining column is not available it performs cross join.
